# When Pigs Fly
---
## Description 

### When Pigs Fly a 2D shoot'em'up (Shmup) that is based all around the type of chaos that would ensue if pigs indeed could fly.  I was the sole developer on this project and used this class assignment as an opportunity to become more familiar with the Unity engine as well as apply vector mathematics even more!  Learning how to use the composite design pattern in a game engine, understanding the effects of fluctuating framerates and working out how to balance hitbox collisions were all my largest challenges during development of this game.  I gained a great understanding of how they work and will be applying my new algorithms in future projects both within Unity and other engines!

## Notes
- This was my first game in the Unity game engine and was used predominantly as a learning experience to get more comfortable with the engine
- This game, while not made for a game jam, was made following a tight schedule of deadlines given out by the associated class
